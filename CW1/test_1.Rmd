## 1. Vectors
Assign a vector of 11 elements (1, 0.3, 5, 6, 5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, 9, 9.7) to the variable `test_a`.  
Please provide your code here:  

### 1.1  
test_a <- c(1, 0.3, 5, 6, 5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, 9, 9.7)

Add 2 to each element of the vector test_a and assign the result to the variable `test_b`. Please provide your code here:  
test_b <- test_a + 2
### 1.2   
test_b <- test_a + 2
Calculate the difference between `test_a` and `test_b`. Please provide your code here: 


### 1.3  
 test_b - test_a
Select the 3rd element of the vector `test_a`.  
Please provide your code here:  

### 1.4  
test_a[3]
Select the 3rd, 4th and 5th elements of the vector `test_a` and assign the result to the vector `test_c`.
Please provide your code here:  

### 1.5  
test_c <- test_a[3:5]
Print `test_c`.
Please provide your code here:  


### 1.6   
test_c
## Factors

Create the vector `test_d` with the elements "apple", "lemon", "orange".


### 2.1   
test_d <- c("apple", "lemon", "orange")
Convert them as factors to the variable `test_e`.  


### 2.2   
test_e <- factor(test_d)
